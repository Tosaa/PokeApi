# PokeKotlin/Native
_A Command line interface written in Kotlin/Native to use the **PokeAPILibrary**._

## Build
Somehow `./gradlew build` is not working. Build needs to be triggered via IDE.

## run
Executable can be found [here](build/bin/native/debugExecutable) or simply be executed by the terminal  
`$ ./build/bin/native/debugExecutable/Pokemon.kexe`
